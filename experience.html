<h3>In 2018, I had the opportunity to join a mission. The mission was organized by my school where we students had to preach in the aboriginal villages. The village is called Kampung Sarok which is located in Gerik Perak. There we were given a foster family and we had to live with them. There we also have to teach the basics of religion and academics to the children there. We sat there for a week. Various activities that we do, such as sports, fardhu ain classes, telematch, river bathing together, farming and many more. My experience there taught me a lot about the religion I follow and the comfort of my life. This is because there they live in poverty but they are still happy. Through this experience as well, I learned to love nature. How beautiful, the stars at night, the untouched clear river, the secluded area, the source of natural food and so on. This experience is a different experience from the others in my life!</h3>
